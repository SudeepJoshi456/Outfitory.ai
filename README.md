2. Create a new Firebase project (if you don't have one).
3. In your project settings, add a web app and copy the Firebase configuration details.
4. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual Firebase configuration values:

    ```plaintext
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
    ```
5. **Set Up OpenWeather API**

To use the OpenWeather API for fetching weather data, follow these steps:

2. Sign up for a free account if you donâ€™t already have one.
3. After logging in, navigate to the API section and obtain your API key.
4. In your `.env.local` file, add the following environment variable:

2. Create a Gemini account if you do not have one and navigate to the API section.
3. Generate your API key and secret.
4. Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

    ```plaintext
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    ```

Make sure to restart your development server after updating the `.env.local` file for the changes to take effect.

7. Run the application
   ``` bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## AI and Machine Learning

In this project, we leverage AI and Machine Learning to enhance user experience by providing personalized outfit recommendations based on the current weather conditions. The key components of our AI implementation include:

- **Weather Data Integration**: We utilize the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data, including temperature and conditions, which informs our outfit suggestions.

- **Outfit Recommendation with Gemini**: We use Gemini to suggest which outfit users should wear today by analyzing the user's closet as stored in the database. This allows us to determine suitable outfits based on the available clothing items and the current weather.

## Future Plans

Our plan is to integrate Google Cloud Vision, enabling users to easily add outfits to their closet. With this feature, users will be able to click pictures of their outfits, and the AI will automatically categorize each item. This seamless integration will ensure that the outfit details are accurately captured and stored in the user's closet in the database, enhancing the overall user experience and making closet management even more intuitive.
